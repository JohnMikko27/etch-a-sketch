# etch-a-sketch
This is a project from The Odin Project 
It seems to be a program where you can 'paint' or 'color' on a blank canvas with a click of the mouse

Future improvements: 
Only color it after clicking on the gridContainer once; 
and when mouse leaves gridContainer, you have to click again, 
to color it

I tried to do this, but it didn't work. After clicking 
rainbowButton once, clicking it again won't change color to a 
random color, but the other colors: red, blue, green, etc. worked

REFACTOR:
I am going to refactor this project after finishing the to-do list project so that I can improve my code maintainability, module creation, and create elegant code
